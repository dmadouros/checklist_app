# ChecklistApp

This is intended to be a playground for me :-)
And it will solve a pet peave of mine with typical checklist apps.

## Playground Roadmap

### To Start

- React and RoR
- redux
- immutable
- focus on TDD w/ rspec
- focus on JS testing w/ chai, mocha, etc.
- try cucumber? (again)
- capybara
- bootstrap
- BEM

Eventually, I'd like to try rewriting it (or parts or it) and/or try

- elm
- vue
- elixir/phoenix
- angular
- docker (maybe split app and run in 2 containers?)
- go
- iphone app
- api design
- microservices
- jwt tokens
- whatever else I feel like or can think of :-)

## Use Cases
1. add checklist template
2. add item to checklist template
3. remove item from checklist template
4. list checklist templates
5. use checklist template
6. check off checklist item
7. tag/group checklist templates
8. complete checklist

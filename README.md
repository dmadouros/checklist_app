# ChecklistApp

This is intended to be a playground for me :-)
And it will solve a pet peave of mine with typical checklist apps.

## Playground Roadmap

### To Start
- React and RoR
- focus on TDD w/ rspec
- focus on JS testing w/ chai, mocha, etc.
- try cucumber? (again)
- capybara
- bootstrap
- BEM

Eventually, I'd like to try rewriting it (or parts or it) and/or try
- elm
- vue
- elixir/phoenix
- angular
- docker (maybe split app and run in 2 containers?)
- go
- iphone app
- api design
- microservices
- whatever else I feel like or can think of :-)
